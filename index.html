    Bridging the Gap between Physics and AI
Introduction

Explores the intersection of physics and artificial intelligence (AI), showcasing how these two fields can collaborate to drive innovation and scientific advancements. Without AI, physics faces challenges such as handling vast datasets, identifying complex patterns, and making precise predictions. AI addresses these issues by efficiently analyzing data, uncovering hidden relationships, and providing accurate models, thereby bridging gaps and enhancing our understanding of physical phenomena.

Background:

If a projectile motion is predicted using a simple linear regression formula, the results can often be inaccurate due to the complex, non-linear nature of real-world dynamics. However, by employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to capture long-term dependencies and temporal patterns, the prediction accuracy can be significantly improved. LSTMs can model the sequential data of projectile motion more effectively, taking into account various influencing factors and their interdependencies, thus achieving a higher accuracy in predictions. [Based from this example](Example-0 Notebook)

Here are some examples of how physics and AI can bridge the gap:

Particle Physics and Deep Learning: Utilizing AI techniques to analyze large datasets from particle physics experiments to identify patterns and new particles. [Learn more](Example-1 Notebook)
